# IDE Index MCP Server Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [4.16.0] - 2026-04-24
### Fixed
- **`ide_find_symbol` ordering, missing/extra results, and qualified-query handling now match IntelliJ's Go to Symbol popup.** The tool previously ran the popup search separately for each registered language handler and concatenated results in handler-iteration order, which destroyed cross-language ranking. Symbol search now issues a single popup-backed call.

### Added
- **`ide_find_symbol` is now available in every compatible JetBrains IDE**, including RubyMine, CLion, DataGrip, Aqua, and DataSpell. Result quality depends on IDE-supplied `ChooseByNameContributor` extensions; `kind` and `qualifiedName` may fall back to generic values for languages the plugin doesn't special-case.

### Changed
- Internal: removed the `SymbolSearchHandler` interface and its nine language implementations (including the Markdown symbol-search handler added in 4.15.0); symbol search is now centralised in `OptimizedSymbolSearch` + `PopupFaithfulSymbolSearch`. Markdown heading navigation remains available through `ide_file_structure`, not `ide_find_symbol`.

## [4.15.0] - 2026-04-24
### Added
- Added Markdown heading support for `ide_find_symbol` and `ide_file_structure`, backed by the bundled JetBrains Markdown PSI/indexes. Fixes [#149](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/149).

## [4.14.1] - 2026-04-22
### Fixed
- Reworked `ide_diagnostics` to use Marketplace-safe public IntelliJ APIs instead of internal highlighting APIs, resolving the JetBrains Marketplace internal API rejection.
- Preserved fresh diagnostics for open editor files while falling back to public batch analysis for closed files, with updated tool messaging that explains the weaker closed-file `WEAK_WARNING` and intention coverage.

## [4.14.0] - 2026-04-21
### Added
- Added a settings toggle to return structured MCP tool payloads as either JSON or TOON.

## [4.13.2] - 2026-04-21
### Fixed
- **Qualified symbol search in `ide_find_symbol` now behaves much closer to IntelliJ's Go to Symbol popup** — queries like `BasicSolver.run` and `test.BasicSolver.run` now resolve the intended symbol instead of being treated like a plain symbol name. Fixes [#144](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/144).

## [4.13.1] - 2026-04-21
### Fixed
- Moving files now works more reliably, especially in PHP projects.

## [4.13.0] - 2026-04-18
### Changed
- **Breaking: covered navigation and adjacent search tools now use built-in `scope` instead of `includeLibraries` / `includeTests`** — `ide_find_references`, `ide_find_implementations`, `ide_call_hierarchy`, `ide_type_hierarchy`, `ide_find_class`, `ide_find_file`, and `ide_find_symbol` now accept `scope` with the built-in values `project_files`, `project_and_libraries`, `project_production_files`, and `project_test_files`. The old boolean parameters are no longer part of the public contract.

### Fixed
- **Covered search/navigation tools now honor the requested built-in scope end-to-end** — library, production-only, and test-only searches now use explicit scoped IntelliJ searches instead of collapsing back to legacy boolean behavior in tool, handler, or contributor fallback paths.

## [4.12.0] - 2026-04-18
### Added
- **Optional library/test filters for navigation tools** — `ide_find_implementations`, `ide_call_hierarchy`, `ide_type_hierarchy`, and `ide_find_references` now accept `includeLibraries` and `includeTests`, both defaulting to `true`, so agents can suppress dependency noise and test-only results when narrowing navigation queries. Addresses [#138](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/138).

### Fixed
- **`includeLibraries=true` now widens hierarchy search scopes correctly** — call-hierarchy and related language-specific navigation searches no longer stay pinned to project-only scope when library results are requested, so callers/implementations from dependency sources can be returned again for library-backed targets.
- **Navigation library/test filtering uses IntelliJ file-index classification** — project files are no longer misclassified as dependencies when filtering results, which preserves project implementations while still excluding actual library/test nodes.

## [4.11.3] - 2026-04-17
### Changed
- Completely reworked `ide_diagnostics` for better reliability and multi-project support.

## [4.11.2] - 2026-04-17
### Fixed
- **External library path round-tripping in read-only navigation tools** — Search results now preserve dependency/library paths, and read-only position-based navigation tools accept those returned absolute paths or `jar://` URLs. Fixes [#135](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/135).
- **Python dotted member definition resolution** — Position-based navigation now prefers the Python callable/member target for dotted expressions like `json.dumps`, `os.path.join`, and `datetime.datetime.now()` when the caret is on the member token, instead of incorrectly jumping to a module/package directory.
- **Python supertypes and super-method hierarchies** — `ide_type_hierarchy` now returns Python supertypes again, and `ide_find_super_methods` now returns inherited Python override chains instead of empty hierarchies.

## [4.11.1] - 2026-04-16
### Fixed
- **`ide_call_hierarchy` callers for Python functions in PyCharm** — Replaced the generic `ReferencesSearch`-based incoming call path with PyCharm's own Python call hierarchy API (`PyStaticCallHierarchyUtil.getCallers()`), so Python caller results now match the IDE's native behavior. Fixes [#133](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/133).
- **Python caller hierarchy compatibility failures are now explicit** — If the required PyCharm Python call hierarchy API is missing or incompatible in the current IDE/Python plugin build, the tool now returns a clear error instead of silently degrading to potentially incorrect results.

## [4.11.0] - 2026-04-15
### Added
- Added a **Project list in error responses** setting with `Expanded` and `Compact` modes. Workspace sub-project/module content roots remain valid `project_path` targets, while compact mode limits invalid/missing `project_path` errors to top-level project roots only.

## [4.10.5] - 2026-04-15
### Changed
- Relaxed IDE compatability requirements to 2025.3+ build, to support Android Studio which doesn't have 2026 yet 

## [4.10.4] - 2026-04-12
### Fixed
- Improved command history stability during concurrent MCP tool calls.

## [4.10.3] - 2026-04-11
### Changed
- **Streamable HTTP is now stateless** — The primary `/index-mcp/streamable-http` transport no longer creates or validates `Mcp-Session-Id` headers. Requests continue working across client reconnects and server restarts without transport reauthentication semantics.

### Fixed
- **Claude Code stale session failure mode** — Removed the transport-level stale session `404` path that Claude Code could surface as a misleading authentication problem, while preserving legacy SSE behavior.

## [4.10.2] - 2026-04-11
### Changed
- **Streamable HTTP is now stateless** — The primary `/index-mcp/streamable-http` transport no longer creates or validates `Mcp-Session-Id` headers. Requests continue working across client reconnects and server restarts without transport reauthentication semantics.

### Fixed
- **Claude Code stale session failure mode** — Removed the transport-level stale session `404` path that Claude Code could surface as a misleading authentication problem, while preserving legacy SSE behavior.
- **`ide_find_references` search failure handling** — Added defensive handling for `LinkageError` / `NoSuchMethodError` failures coming from IDE search infrastructure so affected calls return a structured error with fallback guidance instead of hanging indefinitely.
- **Plugin verification baseline** — Added explicit Plugin Verifier coverage for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate `2026.1` build `IU-261.22158.277` to keep this release line checked against the exact IDE version reported in [#122](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/122).

## [4.10.1] - 2026-04-07
### Fixed
- **`resolveVirtualFileAnywhere` Windows path handling** — Fixed path comparison failures on Windows caused by backslash path separators and case-insensitive VFS normalization. Uses NIO Path-based `isPathPrefixOf` for case-insensitive library JAR validation, and normalizes paths before comparison. Fixes issues where `Z:/Temp` paths were rejected due to VFS normalizing to `Z:/temp`.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- **Symbol reference resolution for position-based tools** — Five tools now accept `language` + `symbol` as an alternative to `file` + `line` + `column` for identifying the target element. The two parameter groups are mutually exclusive. Unlocks the ability to directly reference symbols from third-party libraries.

  Currently supported for Java; extensible to other languages via `SymbolReferenceHandler`. Symbol format uses JavaDoc-style member references: `com.example.ClassName`, `com.example.ClassName#memberName`, or `com.example.ClassName#method(ParamType1, ParamType2)`.

  - Affected tools: `ide_find_references`, `ide_find_definition`, `ide_call_hierarchy`, `ide_find_implementations`, `ide_find_super_methods`
  - New handler interface: `SymbolReferenceHandler` with `JavaSymbolReferenceHandler` implementation
  - New `resolveElementFromArguments()` helper in `AbstractMcpTool` for unified element resolution
  - New `languageAndSymbol()` builder method in `SchemaBuilder`

## [4.9.3] - 2026-04-04
### Added
- **`ide_refactor_rename` file rename mode** — The `line` and `column` parameters are now optional. Omit them to rename the file itself instead of a symbol within it. Works for all file types including binary files (`.webp`, `.png`, `.jpg`). Especially useful for Android resource files where it updates all resource references across the project. Fixes [#115](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/115).

### Fixed
- **`ide_refactor_rename` file rename correctly handles Android resource naming** — When renaming Android resource files (drawables, mipmaps, etc.), the tool now probes `RenamePsiElementProcessor.prepareRenaming()` to detect element substitution. If the `PsiFile` will be substituted for a resource element, the file extension is stripped from `newName` to match the SDK's resource naming convention. This prevents double extensions (e.g., `app_icon.webp.webp`) on related DPI variants and corrupted `R.drawable` references.
- **`ide_refactor_safe_delete` now detects Android resource references for file deletion** — Previously, deleting Android resource files (e.g., `backup_rules.xml`) did not detect `@xml/` or `@drawable/` references in other XML files, allowing deletion despite active references. The tool now checks three layers: direct file references, resource element references (via `prepareRenaming` probe), and top-level symbol references. This correctly blocks deletion when the file is referenced via the Android resource system.

## [4.9.2] - 2026-04-02
### Fixed
- **`ide_refactor_rename` renamed XML attribute name instead of referenced resource** — When renaming inside an XML attribute value (e.g., `android:id="@+id/XXTVProgress"`), the tool incorrectly renamed the attribute name (`android:id`) instead of the referenced resource ID. Now resolves PSI references before falling back to tree-walking, so the rename correctly targets the referenced declaration. Fixes [#113](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/113).

## [4.9.1] - 2026-04-01
### Fixed
- **Path traversal protection for file operations** — All file-based tools now validate that resolved paths stay within project boundaries, preventing access to files outside the project via relative paths like `../../`.
- **JAR reading restricted to project libraries** — `ide_read_file` now only allows reading JARs that are part of the project's configured library roots, blocking access to arbitrary JARs on the filesystem.

## [4.9.0] - 2026-03-30
### Added
- **Enhanced `ide_diagnostics` with build error and test result sources** — The diagnostics tool now supports three independent sources: per-file code analysis (existing), build output from the last build (new), and test results from open test run tabs (new). New parameters: `includeBuildErrors`, `includeTestResults`, `severity` filter (`all`/`errors`/`warnings`), `testResultFilter` (`failed`/`all`), `maxBuildErrors`, `maxTestResults`. The `file` parameter is now optional — omit it to query only build/test results. Fully backward compatible. Addresses [#104](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/104).
- **`BuildDiagnosticsCacheService`** — Persistent project-level service that captures build errors/warnings from all build sources (Gradle, Maven, JPS) as they happen. Queried by `ide_diagnostics` when `includeBuildErrors` is enabled.

### Changed
- Extracted shared build listener reflection code from `BuildProjectTool` into `BuildListenerUtils` utility for reuse.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-03-30
### Added
- **`ide_find_references` and `ide_find_definition`: `astPath` field** — Returns the chain of named AST ancestors (classes, methods, etc.) enclosing the target element, providing structural context for each result without requiring additional file reads.

## [4.7.0] - 2026-03-26
### Added
- Cursor-based pagination for `ide_find_references`, `ide_search_text`, `ide_find_class`, `ide_find_file`, `ide_find_symbol`, and `ide_find_implementations`

### Fixed
- `ide_search_text` context filter (`context: "comments"`, `"code"`, `"strings"`) returned false positives from non-matching contexts

## [4.6.0] - 2026-03-21
### Added
- **`ide_refactor_rename`: `relatedRenamingStrategy` parameter** — Controls automatic renaming of related symbols (same-named properties on unrelated classes, getters/setters, test classes, variables). Options: `"all"` (default, current behavior), `"none"` (rename only the targeted symbol), `"accessors_and_tests"` (only rename getters/setters and test classes/methods), `"ask"` (show IDE dialog for interactive choice). Fixes [#101](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/101).

## [4.5.0] - 2026-03-21
### Added
- **`ide_move_file` tool** — Move files to a new directory using the IDE's refactoring engine. Enabled by default.

## [4.4.1] - 2026-03-19
### Fixed
- **2026.1 compatability issues** 

## [4.4.0] - 2026-03-18
### Added
- **`ide_convert_java_to_kotlin` tool** — Convert Java files to Kotlin using IntelliJ's built-in J2K (Java-to-Kotlin) converter. Supports full file conversion with automatic formatting, import optimization, and code cleanup. Handles classes, interfaces, enums, methods, fields, generics, and Java 8+ features (lambdas, streams, method references). Returns list of created .kt files with line counts and any conversion warnings. Original Java files are automatically deleted after successful conversion. Requires both Java and Kotlin plugins. Disabled by default — enable in Settings → Tools → Index MCP Server.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-03-17
### Added
- **`ide_optimize_imports` tool** — Optimize imports in a file without reformatting code. Removes unused imports and organizes remaining imports according to project code style. Equivalent to the IDE's "Optimize Imports" action (Ctrl+Alt+O / ⌘⌥O). Disabled by default — enable in Settings → Tools → Index MCP Server. ([#94](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/94))

## [4.2.0] - 2026-03-13
### Added
- **Companion Skill** — New "Get Companion Skill" button in the tool window toolbar. Lets users install or export a companion skill that guides AI coding agents on when and how to use IDE MCP tools effectively. Supports direct installation to `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code projects, or export as `.skill`/`.zip` file for sharing.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-13
### Added
- **`ide_build_project` tool** — Trigger project builds via the IDE's build system (JPS, Gradle, Maven). Returns structured error/warning messages with file locations. Supports workspace sub-projects, trusted-project security gate, optional timeout, and optional raw build output. Disabled by default — enable in Settings → Tools → Index MCP Server.
- **Plugin description updates** - Aligned with missing tools and features.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-03-13
### Changed
- **Refactored path resolution in `PsiUtils`** — Extracted `resolveLocalFile`, `resolveAbsolutePath`, `resolveAbsolutePathString`, `expandHome`, and `toPathOrNull` as reusable helpers, eliminating duplicated path normalization logic

### Fixed
- **Integration test used real filesystem** — `ToolExecutionIntegrationTest` now uses `myFixture.addFileToProject()` so test files are properly indexed by the in-memory VFS
- **Path comparison failed on Windows** — `PsiUtilsTest` now normalizes path separators and casing before comparing, fixing test failures on Windows

## [4.0.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **Fixed exception introduced in 4.0.0 that could occur when `ide_sync_files` was used after external file changes**
- **Fixed contructor param renaming forcing modal popup**

## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Primary transport changed** — Default server URL now points to Streamable HTTP endpoint (`/index-mcp/streamable-http`). Existing client configurations using the SSE URL continue to work but should be updated.

## [3.14.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Configurable server host** — Allows the user to configure the listening server host, making it possible to use the MCP server on another machine or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## [3.13.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **`ide_reformat_code` tool** — Reformat code files using the IDE's code style settings (`.editorconfig`, project code style). Equivalent to the IDE's "Reformat Code" action (Ctrl+Alt+L / ⌘⌥L). Supports optional import optimization (`optimizeImports`, default: true), code rearrangement (`rearrangeCode`, default: true), and partial file formatting via `startLine`/`endLine`. Disabled by default — enable in Settings → Tools → Index MCP Server. ([#76](https://github.com/zhoudqa/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/76))

## [3.12.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Tool filter dropdown in tool window was outdated**

## [3.12.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Server stuck on "Initializing..." if `postStartupActivity` doesn't fire** — The MCP server now self-initializes asynchronously from its service constructor instead of depending solely on `postStartupActivity`. This fixes environments where the startup activity silently fails (e.g., due to plugin conflicts or class-loading errors), leaving the server permanently in "Initializing..." state ([#73](https://github.com/zhoudqa/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/73))

## [3.12.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **`overrideStrategy` parameter for `ide_refactor_rename`** — Controls how renaming a method that overrides a base method is handled, enabling fully headless/agent usage without modal dialogs
  - `"rename_base"` (default): Automatically renames the base method and all overrides by resolving to the deepest super method via `PsiMethod.findDeepestSuperMethods()`, bypassing the dialog entirely
  - `"rename_only_current"`: Renames only the current method, leaving the base and other overrides unchanged
  - `"ask"`: Preserves original IDE behavior, showing the dialog for interactive choice

## [3.11.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Codebase refactoring overhaul** — Major internal cleanup reducing ~926 lines of duplication
  - **Generic `PluginDetector`** — Replaced 6 nearly identical plugin detector files (640 lines) with a single generic `PluginDetector` class and `PluginDetectors` registry (~80 lines)
  - **`SchemaBuilder` utility** — All 19 tool input schemas now use a fluent `SchemaBuilder` instead of manual JSON construction, eliminating ~460 lines of boilerplate
  - **Data-driven registration** — Handler and tool registration use data-driven loops instead of duplicated reflection blocks
  - **`ClassResolver`** — Extracted class-by-FQN resolution (PHP/Java) from `AbstractMcpTool` into standalone utility
  - **`ProjectResolver`** — Extracted multi-project resolution logic from `JsonRpcHandler` into independently testable class
  - **`server/transport/` package** — Moved `KtorMcpServer` and `KtorSseSessionManager` to dedicated transport sub-package
  - **Consolidated error builders** — Replaced 4 nearly identical JSON-RPC error response methods with single factory

### Fixed
- **JSON-RPC error responses used unsafe string concatenation** — `KtorMcpServer.createJsonRpcError()` now uses proper `kotlinx.serialization` instead of manual string interpolation, preventing malformed JSON from special characters in error messages
- **Streamable HTTP notifications returned no response** — Notifications (e.g., `notifications/initialized`) sent via Streamable HTTP transport now correctly return `202 Accepted` instead of silently dropping the connection
- **No JSON-RPC version validation** — Server now validates that `request.jsonrpc == "2.0"` and returns `INVALID_REQUEST` (-32600) for non-compliant requests

## [3.10.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Tools stop responding when a modal dialog is open** - MCP tool calls (e.g., `ide_sync_files`, `ide_refactor_rename`) no longer hang indefinitely when a modal dialog (Settings, Registry, refactoring preview, etc.) is open in the IDE

## [3.10.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **`ide_find_definition` crash in PhpStorm and other non-Java IDEs**

## [3.10.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **`matchMode` parameter for `ide_find_symbol` and `ide_find_class`** - Control how queries match symbol names
  - `"substring"` (default) - matches anywhere in name (backward compatible)
  - `"prefix"` - camelCase-aware prefix matching (e.g., "find" matches "findSymbol")
  - `"exact"` - case-sensitive exact match
- **`language` parameter for `ide_find_symbol` and `ide_find_class`** - Filter results by programming language (e.g., `"Kotlin"`, `"Java"`)
- **`maxPreviewLines` parameter for `ide_find_definition`** - Limit `fullElementPreview` output size (default: 50, max: 500)
- **Glob pattern support for `ide_search_text`** - File type filtering via glob patterns (e.g., `*.kt`, `*.gradle.kts`)
- **Kotlin callee resolution for `ide_call_hierarchy`** - Callees direction now works for Kotlin methods by resolving `KtCallExpression` references via reflection
- **Path-based search fallback for `ide_find_file`** - Falls back to path matching when filename search returns no results
- **`ide_file_structure` for JavaScript and TypeScript** - Previously returned "Language not supported". Now works for `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` files

### Fixed
- **`ide_call_hierarchy` callers for Kotlin `suspend fun`** - `MethodReferencesSearch` misses `suspend fun` call sites because the Kotlin compiler appends a hidden `Continuation<T>` parameter to the JVM signature. Added unconditional `ReferencesSearch.search(navigationElement)` alongside `MethodReferencesSearch` (with deduplication) so callers are always found
- **`ide_call_hierarchy` callers inside `val`/`var` assignments** - `resolveKotlinMethod` was stopping at local `val`/`var` PSI nodes (`KtProperty` with no backing JVM method) and returning `null`, silently dropping every such caller reference. Now continues walking up the PSI tree to find the enclosing named function
- **`ide_call_hierarchy` "unknown" caller names for JSX arrow functions** - `findContainingCallable` was returning unnamed anonymous arrow functions (`const App = () => ...`) instead of the enclosing `JSVariable`. Now skips unnamed `JSFunction` nodes and falls back to the containing `JSVariable` for correct caller name resolution
- **`ide_find_symbol`, `ide_find_class`, `ide_search_text`, `ide_find_file` polluted by excluded paths** - All search tools now use a `DelegatingGlobalSearchScope` subclass (`ExcludedPathScope`) that rejects venv, node_modules, build output, and worktree files at the IntelliJ search-infrastructure level. Excluded files never consume buffer slots, replacing the fragile over-fetch-then-filter approach
- **`ide_find_symbol` and `ide_find_class` polluted by venv/node_modules in subdirectories** - Exclusion filter now matches `.venv/`, `venv/`, `node_modules/`, and `.worktrees/` at any path depth (not only at the project root). Fixes multi-module projects where the virtual environment is inside a subdirectory (e.g. `python-services/.venv/`)
- **`ide_find_symbol` exact `matchMode` was case-insensitive** - Changed from `name.equals(pattern, ignoreCase = true)` to `name == pattern`. `"CalendarService"` with `exact` no longer matches `calendarService` properties
- **`ide_find_references` duplicate entries for JSX components** - Opening and closing JSX tags (`<Foo>` / `</Foo>`) resolved to identical `file:line:column` positions, producing duplicate entries. Results are now deduplicated by position
- **`ide_find_references` `truncated` flag incorrectly true after deduplication** - `truncated` was computed as `totalFound > usages.size`, which fired whenever deduplication removed JSX tag duplicates. Now correctly set to `totalFound > maxResults` — only true when results were actually cut off by the limit
- **`ide_find_class` short/generic queries returning 0 results** - Increased `processNames` collection limit from 75 to 5000. The contributor's `processNames` emits names from broader scope (JDK/libraries) even when searching project scope; short patterns like "Tool" would fill the small buffer with library names before reaching project classes
- **`ide_find_class` language filter** - Filter applied at collection time in `processContributor` instead of post-filtering, preventing generic queries from returning 0 results when language filtering
- **`ide_find_symbol` language filter** - Collects 3x more from handlers when filtering and filters during collection loop
- **`ide_find_definition` on import statements** - Class imports now resolve correctly. Package-segment imports resolve to the package directory via `PsiPackage`/`PsiDirectory` handling instead of returning "Definition file not found"
- **`ide_find_definition` compiled class targets** - `effectiveTarget` now uses `navigationElement` when target resolves to compiled class in JAR
- **`ide_search_text` deduplication and false positives** - Results deduplicated by (file, line) and validated that the search word appears in the matched line
- **`ide_find_references` Processor pattern** - Uses streaming `Processor` with early termination instead of `findAll().take(n)` to avoid loading all results into memory
- **`ide_type_hierarchy` Kotlin language detection** - Uses `navigationElement.language.id` to correctly detect Kotlin types instead of reporting them as Java
- **`ide_find_file` build output duplicates** - Filters `bin/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/` output directories from results
- **`ide_search_text` returning results from worktrees and node_modules** - Search results were not filtered by excluded paths; now uses scope-based exclusion like all other search tools
- **`ide_file_structure` duplicate constructors for Java classes** - `PsiClass.methods` includes constructors in IntelliJ PSI, causing constructor entries to appear twice (once from `psiClass.constructors` and once from `psiClass.methods`). Now skips constructor entries when iterating methods

## [3.8.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Tool window footer links** - GitHub, Debugger MCP Server, and Buy Me a Coffee links in the toolbar for quick access
  - "Star/Report Issues" link to the GitHub repository
  - "Try Debugger MCP Server" link to the companion plugin on JetBrains Marketplace
  - "Buy Me a Coffee" link to support the developer

## [3.7.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **New tool: `ide_get_active_file`** - Get the currently active file(s) open in the IDE editor
  - Returns cursor position (line, column), selected text, and language for all visible editors
  - Supports split panes (returns all visible editors)
  - Returns empty list (not error) when no editors are open
- **New tool: `ide_open_file`** - Open a file in the IDE editor with optional navigation
  - Navigate to specific line and column positions
  - Validates parameters (column requires line, line >= 1, column >= 1)

### Disabled by default
- `ide_get_active_file` and `ide_open_file` are disabled by default - enable in Settings > Index MCP Server

## [3.6.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Column numbers in navigation results for better inter-tool flows integration** - `ide_find_implementations`, `ide_call_hierarchy`, `ide_find_symbol`, and `ide_find_super_methods` now include 1-based `column` numbers in their output, matching the existing behavior of `ide_find_references`, `ide_find_definition`, `ide_diagnostics`, and `ide_search_text`

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Workspace project support** - All tools now correctly resolve paths when a JetBrains IDE opens a workspace with multiple sub-projects (modules with separate content roots)

### Fixed
- **SLF4J dependency conflict** - Excluded `org.slf4j` from Ktor dependencies to avoid classloader conflicts with the IDE's bundled SLF4J

## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **New tool: `ide_sync_files`** - Force the IDE to synchronize its virtual file system and PSI cache with external file changes on-demand
  - Use when files were created, modified, or deleted outside the IDE and other tools report stale results
  - Lightweight alternative to the global "Sync external file changes" setting
  - Optional `paths` parameter to sync specific files/directories instead of the entire project

## [3.3.4] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **New tool: `ide_read_file`** - Read source file contents from project or library dependencies
  - Supports multiple file path formats: relative, absolute, jar paths (`path/to/lib.jar!/com/example/Class.java`), and jar URLs
  - Can read files by qualified class name (e.g., `java.util.ArrayList`)
  - Supports optional line range extraction with `startLine` and `endLine` parameters (1-based, inclusive)
  - Automatically detects library files and resolves jar file paths
  - Returns file metadata: language ID, line count, and whether it's a library file

### Changed
- **Enhanced library source navigation** - `ide_find_definition` and symbol resolution now prefer source files (`.java`) over compiled files (`.class`) when library sources are attached
  - Added `PsiUtils.getNavigationElement()` utility for consistent navigation element resolution
  - Improves readability when navigating to library code with attached sources

## [3.3.3] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **Symbol navigation resolution** - `ide_find_class` and optimized symbol search now resolve file/line/name via navigation elements for accurate locations.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **Safe delete file protection** - `ide_refactor_safe_delete` no longer accidentally deletes files when positioned on whitespace/comments. Now returns nearby symbol suggestions instead of deleting the file.
- **File deletion mode** - Added explicit `target_type='file'` parameter to safely delete entire files (only succeeds if no external usages exist)

## [3.3.1] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Kotlin position resolution** - Position-based tools now correctly resolve Kotlin classes and methods when cursor is on a declaration (not just references)
  - Affected tools: `ide_type_hierarchy`, `ide_find_implementations`, `ide_call_hierarchy`, `ide_find_super_methods`
  - Root cause: `PsiTreeUtil.getParentOfType` doesn't match Kotlin PSI types (`KtClass`, `KtNamedFunction`)
  - Solution: Use reflection to find Kotlin PSI elements and convert to light classes

## [3.3.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **New tool: `ide_find_class`** - Class/interface search using CLASS_EP_NAME index
- **New tool: `ide_find_file`** - File search using FILE_EP_NAME index

- **Agent rule uses IDE-specific name** - "Copy rule" now uses the correct IDE-specific server name (e.g., `intellij-index`, `pycharm-index`) instead of hardcoded `jetbrains-index`

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-23

### Fixed
- **MCP spec compliance** - `notifications/initialized` now handled correctly per MCP specification
  - Method renamed from `initialized` to `notifications/initialized` (per spec)
  - Notifications no longer receive a response (spec: "receiver MUST NOT send a response")

### Breaking

- `ide_find_implementations` - Go uses implicit interfaces (structural typing). Use `ide_type_hierarchy` with file+line+column instead to find types that satisfy an interface.
- `ide_find_super_methods` - Go has no inheritance. Methods don't override parent methods; Go uses composition via struct embedding.

### Removed
- Removed design specification files (`design.md`, `MultiIDEPlan.md`, `requirements.md`) - consolidated into CLAUDE.md

## [1.6.0] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- `maxResults` parameter for `ide_find_references` tool (default: 100, max: 500) - enables efficient searches in large codebases
