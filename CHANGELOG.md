# IDE Index MCP Server Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [4.0.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **Fixed exception introduced in 4.0.0 that could occur when `ide_sync_files` was used after external file changes**
- **Fixed contructor param renaming forcing modal popup**

## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Primary transport changed** — Default server URL now points to Streamable HTTP endpoint (`/index-mcp/streamable-http`). Existing client configurations using the SSE URL continue to work but should be updated.

## [3.14.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Configurable server host** — Allows the user to configure the listening server host, making it possible to use the MCP server on another machine or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## [3.13.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **`ide_reformat_code` tool** — Reformat code files using the IDE's code style settings (`.editorconfig`, project code style). Equivalent to the IDE's "Reformat Code" action (Ctrl+Alt+L / ⌘⌥L). Supports optional import optimization (`optimizeImports`, default: true), code rearrangement (`rearrangeCode`, default: true), and partial file formatting via `startLine`/`endLine`. Disabled by default — enable in Settings → Tools → Index MCP Server. ([#76](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/76))

## [3.12.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Tool filter dropdown in tool window was outdated**

## [3.12.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Server stuck on "Initializing..." if `postStartupActivity` doesn't fire** — The MCP server now self-initializes asynchronously from its service constructor instead of depending solely on `postStartupActivity`. This fixes environments where the startup activity silently fails (e.g., due to plugin conflicts or class-loading errors), leaving the server permanently in "Initializing..." state ([#73](https://github.com/hechtcarmel/jetbrains-index-mcp-plugin/issues/73))

## [3.12.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **`overrideStrategy` parameter for `ide_refactor_rename`** — Controls how renaming a method that overrides a base method is handled, enabling fully headless/agent usage without modal dialogs
  - `"rename_base"` (default): Automatically renames the base method and all overrides by resolving to the deepest super method via `PsiMethod.findDeepestSuperMethods()`, bypassing the dialog entirely
  - `"rename_only_current"`: Renames only the current method, leaving the base and other overrides unchanged
  - `"ask"`: Preserves original IDE behavior, showing the dialog for interactive choice

## [3.11.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Codebase refactoring overhaul** — Major internal cleanup reducing ~926 lines of duplication
  - **Generic `PluginDetector`** — Replaced 6 nearly identical plugin detector files (640 lines) with a single generic `PluginDetector` class and `PluginDetectors` registry (~80 lines)
  - **`SchemaBuilder` utility** — All 19 tool input schemas now use a fluent `SchemaBuilder` instead of manual JSON construction, eliminating ~460 lines of boilerplate
  - **Data-driven registration** — Handler and tool registration use data-driven loops instead of duplicated reflection blocks
  - **`ClassResolver`** — Extracted class-by-FQN resolution (PHP/Java) from `AbstractMcpTool` into standalone utility
  - **`ProjectResolver`** — Extracted multi-project resolution logic from `JsonRpcHandler` into independently testable class
  - **`server/transport/` package** — Moved `KtorMcpServer` and `KtorSseSessionManager` to dedicated transport sub-package
  - **Consolidated error builders** — Replaced 4 nearly identical JSON-RPC error response methods with single factory

### Fixed
- **JSON-RPC error responses used unsafe string concatenation** — `KtorMcpServer.createJsonRpcError()` now uses proper `kotlinx.serialization` instead of manual string interpolation, preventing malformed JSON from special characters in error messages
- **Streamable HTTP notifications returned no response** — Notifications (e.g., `notifications/initialized`) sent via Streamable HTTP transport now correctly return `202 Accepted` instead of silently dropping the connection
- **No JSON-RPC version validation** — Server now validates that `request.jsonrpc == "2.0"` and returns `INVALID_REQUEST` (-32600) for non-compliant requests

## [3.10.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Tools stop responding when a modal dialog is open** - MCP tool calls (e.g., `ide_sync_files`, `ide_refactor_rename`) no longer hang indefinitely when a modal dialog (Settings, Registry, refactoring preview, etc.) is open in the IDE

## [3.10.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **`ide_find_definition` crash in PhpStorm and other non-Java IDEs**

## [3.10.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **`matchMode` parameter for `ide_find_symbol` and `ide_find_class`** - Control how queries match symbol names
  - `"substring"` (default) - matches anywhere in name (backward compatible)
  - `"prefix"` - camelCase-aware prefix matching (e.g., "find" matches "findSymbol")
  - `"exact"` - case-sensitive exact match
- **`language` parameter for `ide_find_symbol` and `ide_find_class`** - Filter results by programming language (e.g., `"Kotlin"`, `"Java"`)
- **`maxPreviewLines` parameter for `ide_find_definition`** - Limit `fullElementPreview` output size (default: 50, max: 500)
- **Glob pattern support for `ide_search_text`** - File type filtering via glob patterns (e.g., `*.kt`, `*.gradle.kts`)
- **Kotlin callee resolution for `ide_call_hierarchy`** - Callees direction now works for Kotlin methods by resolving `KtCallExpression` references via reflection
- **Path-based search fallback for `ide_find_file`** - Falls back to path matching when filename search returns no results
- **`ide_file_structure` for JavaScript and TypeScript** - Previously returned "Language not supported". Now works for `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` files

### Fixed
- **`ide_call_hierarchy` callers for Kotlin `suspend fun`** - `MethodReferencesSearch` misses `suspend fun` call sites because the Kotlin compiler appends a hidden `Continuation<T>` parameter to the JVM signature. Added unconditional `ReferencesSearch.search(navigationElement)` alongside `MethodReferencesSearch` (with deduplication) so callers are always found
- **`ide_call_hierarchy` callers inside `val`/`var` assignments** - `resolveKotlinMethod` was stopping at local `val`/`var` PSI nodes (`KtProperty` with no backing JVM method) and returning `null`, silently dropping every such caller reference. Now continues walking up the PSI tree to find the enclosing named function
- **`ide_call_hierarchy` "unknown" caller names for JSX arrow functions** - `findContainingCallable` was returning unnamed anonymous arrow functions (`const App = () => ...`) instead of the enclosing `JSVariable`. Now skips unnamed `JSFunction` nodes and falls back to the containing `JSVariable` for correct caller name resolution
- **`ide_find_symbol`, `ide_find_class`, `ide_search_text`, `ide_find_file` polluted by excluded paths** - All search tools now use a `DelegatingGlobalSearchScope` subclass (`ExcludedPathScope`) that rejects venv, node_modules, build output, and worktree files at the IntelliJ search-infrastructure level. Excluded files never consume buffer slots, replacing the fragile over-fetch-then-filter approach
- **`ide_find_symbol` and `ide_find_class` polluted by venv/node_modules in subdirectories** - Exclusion filter now matches `.venv/`, `venv/`, `node_modules/`, and `.worktrees/` at any path depth (not only at the project root). Fixes multi-module projects where the virtual environment is inside a subdirectory (e.g. `python-services/.venv/`)
- **`ide_find_symbol` exact `matchMode` was case-insensitive** - Changed from `name.equals(pattern, ignoreCase = true)` to `name == pattern`. `"CalendarService"` with `exact` no longer matches `calendarService` properties
- **`ide_find_references` duplicate entries for JSX components** - Opening and closing JSX tags (`<Foo>` / `</Foo>`) resolved to identical `file:line:column` positions, producing duplicate entries. Results are now deduplicated by position
- **`ide_find_references` `truncated` flag incorrectly true after deduplication** - `truncated` was computed as `totalFound > usages.size`, which fired whenever deduplication removed JSX tag duplicates. Now correctly set to `totalFound > maxResults` — only true when results were actually cut off by the limit
- **`ide_find_class` short/generic queries returning 0 results** - Increased `processNames` collection limit from 75 to 5000. The contributor's `processNames` emits names from broader scope (JDK/libraries) even when searching project scope; short patterns like "Tool" would fill the small buffer with library names before reaching project classes
- **`ide_find_class` language filter** - Filter applied at collection time in `processContributor` instead of post-filtering, preventing generic queries from returning 0 results when language filtering
- **`ide_find_symbol` language filter** - Collects 3x more from handlers when filtering and filters during collection loop
- **`ide_find_definition` on import statements** - Class imports now resolve correctly. Package-segment imports resolve to the package directory via `PsiPackage`/`PsiDirectory` handling instead of returning "Definition file not found"
- **`ide_find_definition` compiled class targets** - `effectiveTarget` now uses `navigationElement` when target resolves to compiled class in JAR
- **`ide_search_text` deduplication and false positives** - Results deduplicated by (file, line) and validated that the search word appears in the matched line
- **`ide_find_references` Processor pattern** - Uses streaming `Processor` with early termination instead of `findAll().take(n)` to avoid loading all results into memory
- **`ide_type_hierarchy` Kotlin language detection** - Uses `navigationElement.language.id` to correctly detect Kotlin types instead of reporting them as Java
- **`ide_find_file` build output duplicates** - Filters `bin/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/` output directories from results
- **`ide_search_text` returning results from worktrees and node_modules** - Search results were not filtered by excluded paths; now uses scope-based exclusion like all other search tools
- **`ide_file_structure` duplicate constructors for Java classes** - `PsiClass.methods` includes constructors in IntelliJ PSI, causing constructor entries to appear twice (once from `psiClass.constructors` and once from `psiClass.methods`). Now skips constructor entries when iterating methods

## [3.8.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Tool window footer links** - GitHub, Debugger MCP Server, and Buy Me a Coffee links in the toolbar for quick access
  - "Star/Report Issues" link to the GitHub repository

  - Returns empty list (not error) when no editors are open
- **New tool: `ide_open_file`** - Open a file in the IDE editor with optional navigation
  - Navigate to specific line and column positions
  - Validates parameters (column requires line, line >= 1, column >= 1)

### Disabled by default
- `ide_get_active_file` and `ide_open_file` are disabled by default - enable in Settings > Index MCP Server

## [3.6.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Column numbers in navigation results for better inter-tool flows integration** - `ide_find_implementations`, `ide_call_hierarchy`, `ide_find_symbol`, and `ide_find_super_methods` now include 1-based `column` numbers in their output, matching the existing behavior of `ide_find_references`, `ide_find_definition`, `ide_diagnostics`, and `ide_search_text`

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Workspace project support** - All tools now correctly resolve paths when a JetBrains IDE opens a workspace with multiple sub-projects (modules with separate content roots)

### Fixed
- **SLF4J dependency conflict** - Excluded `org.slf4j` from Ktor dependencies to avoid classloader conflicts with the IDE's bundled SLF4J

## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **New tool: `ide_sync_files`** - Force the IDE to synchronize its virtual file system and PSI cache with external file changes on-demand
  - Use when files were created, modified, or deleted outside the IDE and other tools report stale results
  - Lightweight alternative to the global "Sync external file changes" setting
  - Optional `paths` parameter to sync specific files/directories instead of the entire project

## [3.3.4] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **New tool: `ide_read_file`** - Read source file contents from project or library dependencies
  - Supports multiple file path formats: relative, absolute, jar paths (`path/to/lib.jar!/com/example/Class.java`), and jar URLs
  - Can read files by qualified class name (e.g., `java.util.ArrayList`)
  - Supports optional line range extraction with `startLine` and `endLine` parameters (1-based, inclusive)
  - Automatically detects library files and resolves jar file paths
  - Returns file metadata: language ID, line count, and whether it's a library file

### Changed
- **Enhanced library source navigation** - `ide_find_definition` and symbol resolution now prefer source files (`.java`) over compiled files (`.class`) when library sources are attached
  - Added `PsiUtils.getNavigationElement()` utility for consistent navigation element resolution
  - Improves readability when navigating to library code with attached sources

## [3.3.3] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **Symbol navigation resolution** - `ide_find_class` and optimized symbol search now resolve file/line/name via navigation elements for accurate locations.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **Safe delete file protection** - `ide_refactor_safe_delete` no longer accidentally deletes files when positioned on whitespace/comments. Now returns nearby symbol suggestions instead of deleting the file.
- **File deletion mode** - Added explicit `target_type='file'` parameter to safely delete entire files (only succeeds if no external usages exist)

## [3.3.1] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Kotlin position resolution** - Position-based tools now correctly resolve Kotlin classes and methods when cursor is on a declaration (not just references)
  - Affected tools: `ide_type_hierarchy`, `ide_find_implementations`, `ide_call_hierarchy`, `ide_find_super_methods`
  - Root cause: `PsiTreeUtil.getParentOfType` doesn't match Kotlin PSI types (`KtClass`, `KtNamedFunction`)
  - Solution: Use reflection to find Kotlin PSI elements and convert to light classes

## [3.3.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **New tool: `ide_find_class`** - Class/interface search using CLASS_EP_NAME index
- **New tool: `ide_find_file`** - File search using FILE_EP_NAME index
- **New tool: `ide_search_text`** - Text search using word index with context filtering (code/comments/strings)

### Disabled by default
 - ide_find_symbol

## [3.2.1] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed
- **Performance: Prevent IDE freezes during rapid tool calls** - Switched from blocking `readAction` to yielding `suspendingReadAction` in all tools. This prevents write lock starvation that caused IDE freezes when Claude Code's Explore agent fired many tool calls in succession.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Agent rule uses IDE-specific name** - "Copy rule" now uses the correct IDE-specific server name (e.g., `intellij-index`, `pycharm-index`) instead of hardcoded `jetbrains-index`

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-23

### Fixed
- **MCP spec compliance** - `notifications/initialized` now handled correctly per MCP specification
  - Method renamed from `initialized` to `notifications/initialized` (per spec)
  - Notifications no longer receive a response (spec: "receiver MUST NOT send a response")

### Breaking

  - `ide_diagnostics` - Detect Go code problems (errors, warnings, style issues)
  - `ide_refactor_rename` - Rename Go symbols with automatic JSON tag updates
  - Uses reflection-based handlers to avoid compile-time Go plugin dependency

### Changed
- **Universal Rename Tool** - `ide_refactor_rename` now works across ALL languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, etc.), not just Java/Kotlin
  - Uses IntelliJ's platform-level `RenameProcessor` which delegates to language-specific handlers
  - Language-specific name validation using `LanguageNamesValidation` (identifier rules, keyword detection)
  - Tool is now registered as a universal tool, available in all JetBrains IDEs
  - **Fully headless operation** - No popups or dialogs, suitable for autonomous AI agents
